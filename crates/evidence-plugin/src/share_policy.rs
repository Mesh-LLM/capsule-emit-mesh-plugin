//! This plugin's `config_schema` declaration for
//! the one sharing-policy object -- four switches, one key
//! (`docs/SHARING-POLICY.md`). Declaring it here
//! makes mesh's console render the four switches under Configuration >
//! Plugins with the host's own controls -- nothing here is a score, and
//! nothing here ranks anyone.
//!
//! **How a console value reaches the plugin.** mesh-llm saves what the
//! operator sets in the console to its config file (this plugin's
//! `[plugin.settings]`) and does not pass it to the plugin process (no env,
//! no protocol message). `crate::settings::var` reads it there when the
//! environment does not set the setting. Each key is its env var's suffix
//! lower-cased (`share_record_at_completion` ->
//! `CAPSULES_SHARE_RECORD_AT_COMPLETION`), except `witness`, which
//! is `CAPSULES_CHECKPOINT_WITNESS_URLS`. The witness is read when
//! the plugin starts: restart mesh-llm after changing it.
//!
//! The same schema also declares the opt-in stop-routing rule's two settings
//! (`routing_rule`), under their own "Routing rule" category, on the same
//! env-var convention: `CAPSULES_STOP_ROUTING_AFTER_CONTRADICTIONS`
//! (off unless set) and `CAPSULES_STOP_ROUTING_WINDOW_DAYS`.
