//! The bar window: a node with a referee-signed contradiction for a model is
//! not asked to referee that model for D days (the operator's
//! `referee_bar_days`, 30 unless set).
//!
//! The window runs from the time THIS node recorded the verdict (its
//! `received_at`, or `issued_at` for a verdict it issued), never from a time
//! the referee wrote, so a referee cannot backdate a bar away. A later
//! corroboration does not end it early. It is per model: a bar for one model
//! leaves the node eligible for another. The history stays in the counts.
//!
//! The rules here are decided (2026-09-30), each pinned by a constant and a
//! test of its own name, so a later change flips one constant and one test:
//!
//! - [`BAR_WINDOW_INCLUDES_ITS_END`]: the window is `[t, t + D)`: barred one
//!   second before `t + D`, eligible at exactly `t + D`
//!   (`the_bar_window_is_t_to_t_plus_d_half_open`).
//! - [`LAPSED_BAR_STARTS_WITHOUT_HISTORY`]: once a bar lapses the node is in
//!   tier 2 until it has a corroboration for that model dated after the
//!   lapse (`a_lapsed_bar_is_tier_2_until_a_fresh_corroboration`).
