//! Settlement records in the Evidence panes: the payer node's own sealed
//! observations of `payment.lifecycle.v1`, joined to exchanges by
//! `exchange_id`.
//!
//! The plugin seals one record per lifecycle event it observed, carrying the
//! event's fields verbatim under
//! `model_attestation.compute_attestation["x-mesh-settlement-v1"]`. This
//! module only reads those records; it never computes a sum, a balance or a
//! rate, and it never reaches into the wallet.
//!
//! What one node's records can say, and what they cannot:
//!
//! - A payer book is built from this node's records as the paying side only.
//!   The provider of the same exchange keeps its book on its own node, so a
//!   payer book always reports it as `not_available`.
//! - Records this node sealed as a provider (`observed_by: "provider"`) are
//!   its own book. They never enter a payer book. The host names a provider's
//!   lifecycle events with the id of its own served exchange (the paid
//!   serving path publishes that exchange under the same id), so they join
//!   that row as its provider book (`provider_settlement`); every one is
//!   still counted (`settlement_provider_records`).
//! - An invoice with no settlement this node's wallet reported, and no final
//!   amount, is `outcome_not_reported`: the host emits no event for a payment
//!   whose outcome is uncertain (a lost wallet reply), one that failed, or an
//!   exchange that was interrupted, so the book cannot say which, and says so.
//!   It is never "unpaid".
//! - A paid request refused before any payment state (for example a payment
//!   protocol version the seller does not speak) leaves no lifecycle event at
//!   all: such a row has no payment summary, like a free exchange.
//! - The provider's side of a payment is not something the payer's events
//!   can see, so nothing about it is sent: per-peer counts carry only this
//!   node's own facts, beside `provider_book: "not_available"`.
//! - An exchange with no settlement records has no payment summary at all
//!   (`settlement: null`). That covers a free exchange, a node with payments
//!   off, and a paid request that failed before authorization (the host emits
//!   no lifecycle phase for it). None of those is "unpaid".
//! - The payer's invoice record can arrive after the first token (the host
//!   authorizes at the first canonical token), so nothing here orders
//!   settlement records against the exchange's own record.
