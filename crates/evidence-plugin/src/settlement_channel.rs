//! The host's `payment.lifecycle.v1` mesh channel: payer-side payment
//! lifecycle events the host broadcasts for a paid exchange, parsed and
//! checked here before the plugin seals one settlement record per event
//! (`CapsuleState::emit_settlement_record`).
//!
//! A settlement record is the payer node's own sealed observation of what its
//! host broadcast. The event's `source` says who asserted each value: the
//! payer (`payer_asserted`), the provider's invoice (`provider_asserted`), or
//! the payer's wallet (`wallet_reported`). A record is not a claim that money
//! moved beyond what a `wallet_reported` event says, and never a claim about
//! the provider's books. No records for an exchange means "no payment
//! lifecycle observed" (a free exchange, payments off, or a failure before
//! authorization), never "unpaid".
//!
//! Hosts since `role` and `tokens` were added to the event emit it on both
//! sides of a paid exchange, and this plugin seals both: each record names the
//! side that observed it (`observed_by`: `payer` or `provider`), so a
//! provider's records are never read as the payer's. An event with no `role`
//! comes from a host that emitted the payer side only, and is read as the
//! payer's. The provider side adds its own `terms_accepted`
//! (`provider_asserted`) and a `delivered` phase carrying the delivered-token
//! watermark (`tokens`).
//!
//! [`parse_and_check`] refuses an event whose own `event_ref` does not
//! recompute, and any phase/source/segment/hash combination the host's
//! emitter cannot produce. The combination rules mirror the emitter exactly
//! and are no stricter: in particular a settlement event may carry a `null`
//! `payment_hash`, because the emitter copies the wallet transaction's
//! optional hash as-is.
